# The Iron Yard Rails Engineering Prework
## Atlanta Q2 2015

_Brit Butler (brit@theironyard.com)_

We've got
[a lot](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348)
to cover and precious little time to cover it in. I'm going to ask that you
complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common
starting point and spend class time focusing on things that are most
difficult to learn on your own.

These assignments won't make you a Ruby expert but they will
make sure that you've got a good foundation and don't get lost
right out of the gate.

Importantly, this work will assure me that you

1. can self-direct progress on technical projects
2. have been exposed to some key technologies we'll be using in class
3. can communicate difficulties and accomplishments clearly
4. have reflected on your learning style

Point 2 is not "have internalized every nuance", but I will expect you
to at least be _familiar_ with e.g. `git` and the terminal.

## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **May 02**. Any
deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any
questions, please email or ask on IRC, I'm happy to help (though expect some
good-natured shaming if you're pushing the deadline).

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these
tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough
to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.

## Tasks

### Install OSX Yosemite (if you haven’t already)

* You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If
  you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
* Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store:
  [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
* Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.

WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will
require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch
break.


### Pick and Install a text editor. Practice typing code.

As a developer, you spend most of your time reading, writing, and
editing code, so a text editor is one of the most important tools
to familiarize yourself with. I don't prescribe a particular editor
but would recommend one of the following:

* Sublime Text 3 - Pro: fully featured, very snappy, excellent package
  ecosystem. Con: non-free but you can use it with a nag screen indefinitely.
* Atom - Pro: similar to Sublime, free. Con: can be sluggish,
  especially to open.
* Vim - Pro: powerful modal editor, works in a terminal, free,
  ubiquitous. Con: steeeeep learning curve.
* Emacs - Pro: Free, endlessly tweakable, works in a terminal, every possible
  feature. Cons: endlessly tweakable, every possibly feature, awkward keychords,
  steep learning curve, temptation to fiddle, etc.
* Ruby Mine - Pro: integrated Ruby-aware features (code completion,
  method lookups). Con: non-free, heavyweight.

I'm an Emacs user myself, but won't be requiring it (it distracts
too much from learning to code). I'll use it in lecture and explain 
how to do the same thing in your editors as needed.

If pressed, I would say to pick up SublimeText unless you're already
committed to Emacs or Vim. Sure, it's $60 (or look at a nag screen forever)
but you'll need a good text editor your whole career anyway and while
popular technologies and languages change, editors don't.

Additionally, a **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming
is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to
suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing
typing errors during class. Moreover, typing code is quite different
from typing in emails.

1. Whatever editor you choose, install it and spend some time getting
   comfortable with it (customizing and learning shortcuts, for instance).
   Mastering the tools you use every day will always pay dividends.
2. Work through a few Rails lessons on [Typing.io](http://typing.io).
   Getting some practice in could save you a lot of time the first few weeks of
   class.


### The Command Line

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and
aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If
you've never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to start
getting comfortable.

* (Optional) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environment-and-redirection)
* Read and practice with
  [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)


### Git

Git is a free and open source version control system. Any programming
job worth having will use git or a similar tool to keep to manage changes
to our code and collaboration with other developers.

I use Git on _every_ project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but
just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and
vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and
cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
2. Read through the "Create a Branch" section of [Git from the Inside Out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out).
3. (Optional) If you want to spend some more time with git,
   [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.


### GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git 'repositories'. We will be hosting
all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center
of your programming world for some time to come.

While not the same as a polished resume or portfolio, your Github profile
will be scrutinized by potential employers, and it should be created with that
in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - something professional, if not exactly your name
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Add an SSH Public Key to your account as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).
5. (Optional) Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


### HTML / CSS

Often, our Rails apps will need to produce HTML and CSS.
Unfortunately, we will not spend very much course time on these topics.
Some students will be familiar with these technologies from past experiences.

Especially if you are not, it is quite important that you familiarize
(or re-familiarize)
yourself with them since our coverage in class will be fast paced.

1. Complete the
   [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
2. (Optional) Read through [learnlayout.com](http://learnlayout.com) to better
   understand how to do layout with CSS.

(Treehouse has some additional material that you can check out, though
it goes into more depth than I'd expect you to work through on your
own.)

This class is primarily concerned with data flow and functionality
over design, so a little bit of extra CSS experience can really help
you stand out and make your projects look significantly more polished.


### Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class, but many of the concepts
can take repeated exposure before sinking in. So, you *really* don't
want your first exposure to be in lecture.

1. Start the
   [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby). Work
   through at least "Arrays & Hashes", but feel free to go farther if
   you'd like.
2. (Optional) Sign up for [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) with your new Github
   account. Work through the Ruby track as best as you can. The important thing
   here isn't to complete everything but to spend some time applying what you've
   learned.


## Reflection / Deliverables

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy
any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling
about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How
can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you
anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where
do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

1. Write up your reflections (with your github username) and send them to me
   via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflections throughout the course -
if you feel comfortable sharing publicly, this would be a good time to
start a blog and post them there.


## Feedback & Community

You will be added to basecamp and slack at the beginning of the course,
but there is not a proper forum or mailing list for discussion of work
beforehand.

In light of that, I'll be hanging out on the **Freenode**
[IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client) network hosting an #ironyard chatroom
until the course starts. Feel free to sign on, discuss prework, ask general
questions, discuss programming issues, and just get to know me and
each other. I'll be checking messages/logs a few times a day.

If you've never used IRC before, don't worry. There's no need to install anything.
Just click the link above, select *Freenode* as the featured network on the right,
write in `#ironyard` as the Channel and pick a nickname.
