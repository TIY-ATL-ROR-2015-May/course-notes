## Policies

In general, I'll be treating you like autonomous adults, which means
**you will have plenty of rope to hang yourself**. There are a few things I'll
make explicit though...

### Attendance

Attendance is expected every day class is in session, but not required. If you
miss more than **4** days, your job placement may be forfeit.

### Coursework

Homework will be assigned daily and semi-regularly discussed in class the next
day. It is **your** responsibility to be sure you're keeping up with the
homework and seek out help (from a TA or me) if you're struggling.

The course will culminate in a large final project, likely in a group
with 1 or 2 Mobile or Frontend developers. The last 3 weeks of class will
focus on building these projects, and lectures will be largely curtailed.

It's worth thinking about what you'd like to build now as this project
will likely be the anchor of your portfolio and an important part of
your hiring success after graduation.

### Code of Conduct

In short

In long

    Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made
    up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

    Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
    communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground
    rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're taking a class at
    The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to teachers, students, other staff,
    and guest lecturers.

    This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it
    in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich
    all of us, the technical communities in which we participate.

    This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class,
    Slack, IRC, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

    If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
    report it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking
    to your teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.

    Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.

    Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
    depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your
    colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
    decisions.

    Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
    excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
    frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
    a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people
    feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the
    Iron Yard community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
    well as with people outside the Iron Yard community.

    Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or
    put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
    sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class.
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
      then stop.

    When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
    technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is
    important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
    Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its
    varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
    have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
    someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that
    it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather
    offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.

We probably won't cover every leaf, but we will at least visit each
branch. A timeline will be posted shortly that will give a better idea
of our path through the tree.
